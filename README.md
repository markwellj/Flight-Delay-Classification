# Flight-Delay-Classification

Project was assaigned and completed during the first semester (Fall 2020) of my MSc in Business Analytics. 

We were able to pick our own research objective(s):

RESEARCH objective:
  1. Create Classification Algorithms to predict if a flight would depart delayed.
  2. Use algorithms that can provide a level of importance for factos that may cause delay.

-Chose Southwest airlines for closer inspection because they were the largest domestic carrier represented in the dataset. 
-Chose 10 most frequent departure points for SW airlines. 

Algorithm Overviews:
-Chose Logitstic Regression, Single Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms because of their ability to provide insight into 'feature importance.'
-Chose Accuracy, AUC, Specificity and Sensitivty as evaluation metrics.
-Random Forest showed the best classification performance with all metrics between 58% and 62%. 
  -Report serves as a basis for methodology but results are hampered by a lack of features like weather data and the exclusion of flight propogation information. 


Data Set - 2008 FAA data, is inculuded in repository.
